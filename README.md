# MOTIVATION

I want to know pros and cons of different framework having one API.
I want to write simple tasks for each of them because.
One task is small and similar to TODO like and another - big with routings, different FORM strategics.

I want to have all in one repository and use makefile to build `dist/<project-name>/index.html`.

# INSTALL

Build directory is in `./dist`. To build all projects run
```bash
make all

```

To clean node_modules, etc use `make clean`

# IMPLEMENTATION
